A `golang` based application for `managing tv-shows & movies` (only renaming and copying for now).  
It is developed as a part of my home server infrastructure since existing solutions were too overpowered and heavy for the use case.   
Also, it serves as an excuse to learn [![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/--00ADD8?logo=go&logoColor=ffffff)](https://golang.org/)
